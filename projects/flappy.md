In the summer of 2017, before learning anything about programming, I made a simple game using the flappy bird template on [code.org](https://code.org/). Although this website is for kids, I played around with it to get a basic idea of what coding would be like. This experiences ended up being beneficial in shaping a programmer mindset and it exposed me a little bit to object oriented programming by making an object and giving it properties.
