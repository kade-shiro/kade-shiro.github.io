##You Might Want To Rephrase That

As a kid I was always told, "no question is a dumb question", but time and time again people have proven otherwise, 
causing facepalms and evoking confusion with the occasional "smart question". Curiosity is a learning process and
the intent of wanting to learn something is never dumb, but questions that are redundant and inefficient do become
frustrating and may come off as uneducated. This idea is very apparent in forums or other resources that have a 
multitude of people cycling through thousands of questions where those experts just don't have the time to answer
elementary problems. Stack overflow is a product of this, as a programming forum collecting many smart and not so
smart questions.

##The Not So Smart

One particular post that I came across was short and sweet, and also a basic math question on a programming forum.
The problem that the person had was, how to turn the difference of two numbers into a percentage value, and the
post had 4 answers and -26 downvotes. The problem itself was simple enough to do a quick google search but the
comments were kind enough to provide multiple solutions along with stating it's an unrelated topic. The post is 
now closed for being off-topic and exists only to be example of a not so smart question.
