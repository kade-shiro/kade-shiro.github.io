summary: A database project from ICS 212 to hold user accounts.
--- 

Bank Database Application was the second project for my ICS 212 class. It was converted from C code to C++
which originated from my first project of this course. This program was meant to hold an account for users in a collective
database and displayed a user-interface on start-up. This program is capable of adding new records, removing existing 
records, displaying all or certain records, and exiting the application. 

This course was my introduction to the C and C++ languages and this program, being my final project, has taught me many
things about object oriented programming. We were required to use many pointers, and linked-list methods as well as input
and output functions. Throughtout this I learned the concept of tracing and how to debug my own code with efficiency. 

This project can be found in my repository [
