I've been doing band for 7 years and participated in marching band for 5 years. I started marching during my freshman year at Castle High
School playing the bass drum, and that instrument stuck with me for most of my marching career which ended freshman year at UH. I
also became bass section leader during my junior year, but tried the tenor drums as a senior.

Being a bass drummer has taught me many lessons on top of being a musician. Unlike other marching instruments, bass drummers are 
responsible for 5 or 6 notes split up amongst that number of players, where other instruments could play all those notes on a single 
instrument and this taught me the value of teamwork. As a bass section leader, I was also responsible for connecting all those minds
together. Marching band in general also gave me the coordination to work professionally and collectively with upwards of 60 people. It's
an experience that I'm grateful for from it's many values of teamwork and leadership.
