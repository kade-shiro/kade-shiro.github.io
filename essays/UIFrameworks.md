## My Expectations

  Everything about web development was new to me when I started learning HTML and UI's, and initially I thought they were going to be just as frustrating as other programming languages. I started programming with Java which at first seemed like a foreign language, but when I got to learn C and C++, I found those to be more primitive and complicated. Needless to say, I found learning new programming languages to be a struggle and even though HTML seemed a lot simpler, there was still some frustrations like formatting and making things visually appear how I intended them to. Fortunately, I learned Semantic UI soon after HTML which was the solution to most of my programming problems.

## Code That Makes Sense

  HTML and Semantic UI were quick to pick up but I still have a lot to learn, so in that sense why even learn Semantic UI if it just means more work? My perspective of this is it becomes more efficient when you can read and write code using basic english and on top of that, the Semantic framework implements a bunch of pre-made classes. Ever since I started programming, I pondered the idea of coding in a language that's similar to english because it would be a lot easier. Semantic UI doesn't quite allow me to write, 'scroll the web page down' and expect it to work, but it is a lot closer than previous languages. I can write a class, 'large white container' at ease and get exactly that without the tedious work of assigning variables. This also becomes efficient when it comes to debugging. The bulk of my bugs have been from spelling errors oppose to coding styles like missing a semicolon, which I would otherwise make a lot of.

## Ease of Use

  I've also been using Semantic's tools frequently as if there was no other way to code in HTML. Menus and grids have become a life saver for formatting, where the alternative would be manually setting each padding. Semantic also has a library of icons and other aesthetics which is a lot easier to find and use instead of amassing a bunch of images. Semantic UI's website also adds the the ease of use by making tools easier to find.

## Prettier

  In addition to the coders perspective, the UI becomes a lot cleaner. When given the option, people would often use the website with the nicer design with disregard to the content at first glance. Frameworks add liveliness and even if raw HTML and CSS were able to recreate the appearance, it would be less efficient in comparison. One example would be semantics dropdown module, which is organized and gives the user more access rather oppose to looking at long lists or surfing through links.

## In Conclusion

  Semantic UI and frameworks add an abundance of ease for both the coder and the user that becomes well worth the extra time it takes to learn and implement it. There's just so much possibilities with Semantics that it seems pointless to program without it.
