## Hmm

As a freshman in college, I had no clue if computer science would be the right choice for me, but I knew I wanted to pursue
something that would let me explore my creativity. Being an artist seemed too risky and unstable for a career, and although
I was in band, I wasn't cut out to be a musician for the rest of my life so I thought I would try out programming. At the
time I was optimistic and slightly naive, thinking it would be the best decision of my life, but I came to realize 
programming is nothing but struggles. However, through all the bugs and error statements, I did enjoy making things work
out of a few lines of code and that lead me to pursue game development. 

## I Wan't So Sure

Great, I focused my aspirations towards a goal, but I wasn't certain just yet. The concepts and problem solving were fun
but implementing them still felt tedious. Maybe this was because we had to write from scratch or maybe I was just not use
to it yet. Either way I knew I had to get through those beginner level courses because the more code I wrote, the better
I would get and eventually reach my goal.

## The Future's Not So Grimm

Along the way to my degree, I hope to learn a wide variety of skills, like networking and professionalism, and I hope to
better develop my programing knowledge with software engineering and other future courses. It's only been a week but 
ICS314 has already shown me valuable resources with things like linkedin and github, and although the rest of the
curriculum isn't directly related to game development, it seems promising and very beneficial to that pathway and I'm
looking forward to it.
