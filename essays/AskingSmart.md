## You Might Want To Rephrase That

As a kid I was always told, "no question is a dumb question", but time and time again people have proven otherwise, causing facepalms and evoking confusion with the occasional "smart question". Curiosity is a learning process and the intent of wanting to learn something is never dumb, but questions that are redundant and inefficient do become frustrating and may come off as uneducated. This idea is very apparent in forums or other resources that have a multitude of people cycling through thousands of questions where those experts just don't have the time to answer these elementary problems. Stack overflow is a product of this, as a programming forum collecting many smart and not so smart questions.

## The Not So Smart

One particular post that I came across was short and sweet, and also a basic math question on a programming forum. The problem that the person had was, how to turn the difference of two numbers into a percentage value, and the post had 4 answers and -26 downvotes. The problem itself was simple enough to do a quick google search but the comments were kind enough to provide multiple solutions along with stating it's an unrelated topic. The post is now closed for being off-topic and exists only to be example of a not so smart question. 

## The Smart

I was also able to discover a pretty well made post that had 28 upvotes and 13 answers, eventhough the writer opened his topic with "It sounds stupid". The post was a syntax question wanting to know why if statements reqiure parenthesis even for one-line conditions in C languages. Although it's a simple question and it recieved simple solutions, the person asking it followed the standards that were acceptable for posting in forums, by providing their search history, and stating specifically what they are looking for. This post compelled people to respond for good reasons and is a solid example of what a smart question looks like. 

## Some Insight

In short, smart questions save a lot of other peoples' time and more often than not, compel more people to respond to your issues. Before this experience of searching the do's and don'ts, I was probably one of those clueless people asking dumb questions, but this has taught me the value of phrasing problems properly. This  standard is important in every subject but expecially in software engineering, where programmers are pressed for time and need the best solution as fast as possible.
